# prophage_encoded_defense
E. coli prophages harbor an arsenal of defense systems that protect against other temperate phages

Files and code used for finding homologs of anti-phage defense systems discovered in E.coli temperate phages, and the likelihood these homologs are also associated with prophages.

Csv files with the taxIDs and corresponding genomes for the homologs are included.
